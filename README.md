This repository contains 4 tasks related to the database.

The **first two tasks** are related to implementing SQL queries(using window functions,subqueries,etc.) as RESTful API endpoints and transforming the results into JSON format.

You can see the queries from the **first task** [here](https://github.com/aleksavtr/DBS-SQL-Assignments/blob/main/task1/dbs_assignment/enpoints/queries.py)
Queries of the **second task** are [here](https://github.com/aleksavtr/DBS-SQL-Assignments/blob/main/task2/dbs_assignment/enpoints/queries.py)

The [**third task**](https://github.com/aleksavtr/DBS-SQL-Assignments/tree/main/task3) was to create a database model, specifically  to create a database for the museum, 
and in the [**4th task**](https://github.com/aleksavtr/DBS-SQL-Assignments/tree/main/task4), to create  functions/procedures to perform various scenarios for manipulating data in the database.
